Disclosure of sensitive personal data by a hospital to a third party. 2017
1. What is the specific aspect of GDPR that your case study addresses?

The complainant in the case study rejected the apology made by the hospital as being not a suitable solution and instead requested an official decision from the commissioner. The commissioner held an investigation and found that the hospital violated the following sections of Data Protection Act 1988 and 2003. The complainant’s sensitive personal information (medical reports) was sent at the wrong address and accidently shared with the third party.

.Section 2(1)(b) - requirement to keep personal data accurate, complete and up to date.

.Section 2(1)(d) - requirement to take appropriate security measures.

.Section 2B(1) - requirement for a legal basis for processing sensitive personal data.

2. How was it resolved?

The medical reports from the hospital are kept in the windowed envelope to be sent to the GP but in this case the staff member kept the report in the non-windowed envelope with a hand written address that itself was wrong. The address was a mix of GP surgery address and the complainant address. However, the hospital is unsure how it ended up at the neighbour’s place. The hospital administration briefed the responsible staff and also briefed the other members of the staff to adhere to the standard procedure.

3. If this was your organisation what steps would you take as an Information Security Manager to mitigate the issue?

.Ensuring strict compliance to the standard procedure.
.Constant training of the staff.
.Building infrastructure that ensures proper workflow.
.Limiting the personal information provided through the letter and ensuring that in case of such events limited personal information would be shared with non-authorised person.
.Bringing automation to reduce human error.
.Ensuring right steps have been taken by incident response team to mitigate the risks for any future events.
.Ensuring a DPO (data protection officer) is being appointment to deal with any violations of GDPR and to take necessary steps.
